Here are several powerful enhancements we can implement to significantly improve your RAG system:

1. **Advanced Document Processing and Chunking**:
- Implement sliding window chunking with semantic overlap
- Add metadata extraction and tracking
- Support for hierarchical chunking based on document structure
- Implement smart chunk truncation based on semantic completeness

2. **Enhanced Retrieval Pipeline**:
- Add reranking using a cross-encoder model
- Implement Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) for diversity
- Add query expansion/rewriting
- Time-aware retrieval for versioned documents
- Implement hypothetical document embeddings

3. **Improved Answer Generation**:
- Add structured output parsing
- Implement answer validity checking
- Add source attribution and confidence scoring
- Support streaming responses
- Implement chain-of-thought reasoning

4. **Memory and Context Management**:
- Add long-term conversation memory
- Implement memory summarization
- Add document-specific conversation tracking
- Implement context window optimization

5. **Evaluation and Feedback**:
- Add automatic answer evaluation
- Implement relevance scoring
- Add user feedback collection and tracking
- Implement automated testing against golden datasets

Would you like me to implement any of these improvements? I can start with the most impactful ones first. Here's how I would prioritize the implementations:

1. First Tier (Highest Impact):
- Cross-encoder reranking
- Sliding window chunking
- Answer validation
- Source attribution

2. Second Tier:
- Memory management
- Query expansion
- Structured output
- Evaluation metrics

Let me know which improvements you'd like to see implemented and I'll provide the enhanced code!
