# SpaceX Falcon 9 Specifications

The SpaceX Falcon 9 is a partially reusable two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift launch vehicle designed and manufactured by SpaceX. Here are some key specifications:

## First Stage
- Engines: 9 Merlin 1D engines
- Thrust (sea level): 7,607 kN (1,710,000 lbf)
- Thrust (vacuum): 8,227 kN (1,850,000 lbf)
- Specific impulse (sea level): 282 seconds
- Specific impulse (vacuum): 311 seconds
- Burn time: 162 seconds

## Second Stage
- Engines: 1 Merlin Vacuum engine
- Thrust: 934 kN (210,000 lbf)
- Specific impulse: 348 seconds
- Burn time: 397 seconds

## General Specifications
- Height: 70 meters (230 ft)
- Diameter: 3.7 meters (12 ft)
- Mass: 549,054 kg (1,210,457 lb)
- Payload to Low Earth Orbit (LEO): 22,800 kg (50,265 lb)
- Payload to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO): 8,300 kg (18,300 lb)
- Payload to Mars: 4,020 kg (8,860 lb)

The Falcon 9 has been used for various missions, including cargo resupply to the International Space Station (ISS) and deploying commercial satellites. Its first stage is designed to be recoverable, often landing either on an autonomous spaceport drone ship in the ocean or on land.


Now, let's consider two prompts:

Prompt where a typical RAG system might struggle:
"What is the thrust of the Falcon 9's second stage engine?"
Prompt where the hybrid approach with BM25 should succeed:
"Tell me about the Falcon 9's engine thrust in vacuum conditions."

Explanation:

For the first prompt, a typical RAG system using only semantic search might struggle because:

The question is very specific, asking for a single data point.
Semantic search might not distinguish between first and second stage engine information effectively.
The embeddings might not capture the importance of the specific numeric value.

A semantic-only approach might provide general information about the Falcon 9's engines or confuse first and second stage specifications.
For the second prompt, the hybrid approach with BM25 should perform better because:

It contains keywords like "Falcon 9," "engine," "thrust," and "vacuum" that BM25 can match directly in the text.
These keywords appear in both the first and second stage specifications, allowing the system to retrieve relevant information from both sections.
The semantic search component can still help in understanding the context of the query and retrieving relevant surrounding information.

The hybrid approach would likely retrieve both the first stage vacuum thrust (8,227 kN) and the second stage thrust (934 kN, which is in vacuum), providing a more comprehensive and accurate answer.
