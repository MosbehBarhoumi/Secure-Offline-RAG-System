1,"What qualities are defined in tables describing attributes, commands, etc.?","In tables describing attributes, commands, etc. for the Matter communication standard, qualities defined typically include data types (like integers, strings), ranges, default values, and any constraints or units of measure applicable to each attribute or command.

These tables help ensure consistent behavior across different devices by defining how certain aspects of their operations should be interpreted or expected."
2,What does the UniqueID Attribute indicate?,The UniqueID attribute in the Matter protocol indicates a unique identifier assigned to an endpoint or device within a smart home network. Ensuring its uniqueness helps avoid conflicts and maintains proper identification of devices across different hubs or systems.
3,What is the signature algorithm used to sign the DAC?,"In the Matter standard, the signature algorithm used for the Device Association Certificate (DAC) is typically ECDSA with a P-256 curve. The signature field of the DAC should contain the digital signature generated using this algorithm over the certificate and related data.

For the specific signature algorithm used in the DAC:

The signature algorithm used to sign the DAC in the Matter standard is ECDSA with P-256."
