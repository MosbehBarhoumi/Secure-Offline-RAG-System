Each bridged device installs the update independently while the bridge monitors this process to ensure all devices are updated successfully.

All updates are securely verified using cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized firmware changes. The bridge ensures that only trusted and validated updates are installed on the bridged devices. If an update fails, the bridge can initiate a rollback process to restore the previous version of the software. Detailed logs and notifications help in troubleshooting any issues during the update process."

1023,How is the KDF implemented in Matter?,"The KDF (Key Derivation Function) in Matter takes the derived key (DK), a label, and an iteration count as inputs. It produces a specific length output using a secure hash function such as SHA-256 to derive keys for encryption or authentication purposes."
1024,What role does the open standard of Matter play in promoting transparency and validation of protocol and security controls?,"The Matter protocol supports secure device commissioning through mechanisms such as Secure Boot, Device Authentication, Key Exchange, and Secure Bootstrapping. These features ensure that only authorized firmware is loaded, mutual authentication confirms both provisioning agent and device identities, secure keys protect communication integrity, and devices can join networks securely without exposing sensitive information."
1025,What is the purpose of the Message Extensions field?,"The **Message Extensions** field in Matter messages allows for inclusion of additional data or custom information alongside standard fields. This enables implementers to add vendor-specific or application-specific information not covered by the core protocol specifications, extending functionality and interoperability without modifying the base protocol structure."
1026,What is the Cache-and-sync policy in MCSP?,"The Cache-and-Sync policy in MCSP caches configuration data locally to ensure offline functionality and syncs with the server upon reconnection. The Message Extensions field extends functionality, includes vendor-specific information, and enables application-specific data."
1027,acronym of  PKI ,"The purpose of the Cache-and-Sync policy in MCSP is to ensure secure message counter synchronization by caching and syncing the message counter with unsynchronized peers, reducing latency compared to Trust-first but requiring initial out-of-band configuration."
1028,What does the RebootCount attribute indicate?,The RebootCount attribute indicates a best-effort count of the number of times the Node has rebooted.
1029,"What threat involves a malicious Device off the network causing a battery-powered Device to wake too often, leading to shortened battery life of nearby Devices?",The RebootCount attribute indicates a best-effort count of the number of times the Node has rebooted.
1030,What information does the Group Peer State Table store for each peer node?,"The Group Peer State Table stores information about each peer node's current state, last seen time, and other relevant status for managing group membership and configurations. This ensures all nodes are up-to-date with group settings."
1031,What is the purpose of the Revision History in the Software Diagnostics Cluster?,"The Revision History in the Software Diagnostics Cluster provides a record of software revisions, including version numbers, dates, and notes about changes or fixes. This facilitates tracking updates, debugging issues, and ensuring compliance with security patches and functional enhancements."
1032,What is the scope of the Binding cluster's access quality in the context of endpoint interactions?,The Binding cluster ensures reliable and efficient communication paths between endpoints through bound services. It optimizes binding checks to minimize performance impact while enhancing security by authorizing only authorized bindings. This improves user experience by enabling seamless device interactions.
1033,What does the Matter protocol support in terms of administration?,"The Matter protocol supports secure device commissioning and management through mechanisms such as Secure Boot, Device Authentication, Key Exchange, and Secure Bootstrapping. Secure Boot ensures only authorized firmware is loaded. Device Authentication performs mutual identity confirmation between provisioning agent and device during setup. Key Exchange securely transmits keys for communication integrity. Secure Bootstrapping enables devices to join networks securely without exposing sensitive information."
1034,What is the Distributed Compliance Ledger?,"The Matter protocol supports secure device commissioning through secure boot, device authentication, key exchange, and secure bootstrapping. These mechanisms ensure only authorized firmware is loaded, mutual identity confirmation between the provisioning agent and the device, secure transmission of keys for communication integrity, and secure network joining without exposing sensitive information."
1035,What is contained within the InvokeResponses tag in InvokeResponseMessage?,"The InvokeResponses tag in an InvokeResponseMessage contains responses to commands or methods invoked by a client. These responses include status codes indicating success or failure, along with output parameters from the invoked method."
1036,How is the Time of Day data type structured in the Matter Specification?,"The Time of Day data type in Matter Specification is represented as a 64-bit unsigned integer encoding the number of seconds since midnight on January 1, 1970. Each increment represents one second from that epoch."
1037,What happens if regulatory information is set outside a valid country in the SetRegulatoryConfig Command?,"The device might reject the invalid configuration and revert to its default settings or refuse to operate. Some features may become unavailable if they are not supported in the non-valid regulatory domain. The device might not be able to communicate with other devices that adhere to valid regulations, leading to interoperability problems. Setting invalid regulatory information can result in non-compliance with local and international standards, potentially causing legal or technical issues."
1038,What boot mechanism should Devices have to verify the authenticity of firmware?,"Secure boot mechanisms require devices to have a trusted boot process that verifies the authenticity of firmware before loading it. This involves a secure boot loader running first upon power-on and checking the digital signature of the firmware against a trusted public key, ensuring no tampering has occurred. Additionally, some implementations use a Trusted Platform Module for enhanced security by securely storing keys and performing cryptographic operations."
1039,What fields are included in the basic constraints extension structure in the Matter certificate structure?,The basic constraints extension structure in the Matter certificate includes two main fields: cA (Certification Authority) set to TRUE for a CA and pathLenConstraint set to 1.
1040,What is the purpose of an Entry Index in the Matter Specification?,"The Entry Index provides a unique identifier for each entry in various data structures ensuring distinct identification. It enables efficient data retrieval by allowing targeted access to specific entries without scanning entire lists, enhancing performance and reducing processing time. In configuration management, it facilitates precise updates to parameters through their index, supporting effective and rapid changes."
